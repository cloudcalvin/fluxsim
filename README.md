# README #

This is the README for the S.F.Q. Verilog Simulator(svs), or S.F.Q. Gate Level Verilog Simulator(sgvs/sgs/sgls) or 
Fluxon Optimized Gate-Level Simulator(fogs) (name pending).

### Overview ###

The svs/sgvs/sgs/sgls/fogs gate-level HDL simulator, hopes to allow S.F.Q. specific circuits to be simulated at 
the gate level at higher speed than is possible using conventional voltage-level-logic simulators
by taking dvantage of the discrete nature of S.F.Q. logic.  

It makes use of a hybrid simulation technique that uses both event-based and cycle-based simulation models.
